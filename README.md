### How it works
This is my finished Rock, Paper and Scissors game. In this game you can choose one of the 3 options and play a game of rock, paper and scissors against the computer, the first to reach 5 points wins. The page shows the scores of each player and displays the selected option on each round, when a player reaches 5 points the game ends and a play again button pops in, if the button is clicked, the game restarts and the scores are set to 0. This project was made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS for learning purposes.
