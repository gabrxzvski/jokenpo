This is my finished rock, paper and scissors game, in this game you can choose one of the 3 options and play a game of rock, paper and scissors against the computer, the first to reach 5 points wins. The page shows the scores of each player and displays the selected option on each round, when a player reaches 5 points the game ends and a play again button pops in, if the button is clicked, the game restarts and the scores are set to 0. This is for learning purposes only, a project from The Odin Project.
